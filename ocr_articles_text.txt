Article 3

Cumulation of Origin
1. Notwithstanding Article 2 (General Requirements), products shall be considered as originating in the exporting Party
if such products are obtained there by incorporating materials originating in the other Party, provided that the working or

processing carried out in the exporting Party goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 6 (Insufficient Working or
Processing).

2. Materials listed in Annex III to this Protocol (Materials Referred to in Paragraph 2 of Article 3) originating in an
ASEAN country which applies with the Union a preferential trade agreement in accordance with Article XXIV of GATT

products listed in Annex IV to this Protocol (Products Referred to in Paragraph 2 of Article 3).

3. For the purpose of paragraph 2, the origin of the materials shall be determined according to the rules of origin
applicable in the framework of the Union’s preferential trade agreements with those ASEAN countries.

and the Republic of Korea, of the other part, except for the rules set out in Annex II(a) to the Protocol concerning the
Definition of "Originating Products" and Methods of Administrative Cooperation of that preferential trade agreement.

9. For the purpose of paragraph 7, the originating status of the fabrics exported from the Republic of Korea to Viet
Nam to be used in further working or processing shall be established by a proof of origin as if those fabrics were
exported directly from the Republic of Korea to the Union.

are considered to be sufficiently worked or processed when the conditions set out in Annex II to this Protocol are

fulfilled.

2. The conditions referred to in paragraph 1 indicate, for all products covered by this Agreement, the working or
processing which must be carried out on non-originating materials used in manufacturing and apply only in relation to
such materials.

If a product which has acquired originating status by fulfilling the conditions set out in the list is used in the manufacture
of another product, the conditions applicable to the product in which it is incorporated do not apply to it, and no
account shall be taken of the non-originating materials which may have been used in its manufacture.

product, may nevertheless be used, provided that their total value or net weight assessed for the product does not exceed:

(a) 10 per cent of the weight of the product or ex-works price for products of Chapters 2 and 4 to 24 of the HS, other
than processed fishery products referred to in Chapter 16 of the HS; or

materials as specified in Annex II to this Protocol.

5. Paragraphs 3 and 4 do not apply to products wholly obtained in a Party within the meaning of Article 4 (Wholly
Obtained Products). Without prejudice to Article 6 (Insufficient Working or Processing) and paragraph 2 of Article 7
(Unit of Qualification), the tolerance provided for in paragraphs 3 and 4 applies to the sum of all the materials which are
used in the manufacture of a product for which Annex II to this Protocol requires that such materials be wholly obtained.

products. When a set is composed of originating and non-originating products, the set as a whole shall be regarded as
originating, provided that the value of the non-originating products does not exceed 15 per cent of the ex-works price of
the set.

Article 10

Article 11

Accounting Segregation

1. If originating and non-originating fungible materials are used in the working or processing of a product, the
competent authorities may, at the written request of economic operators, authorise the management of materials
using the accounting segregation method without keeping the materials in separate stocks.

2. The competent authorities may make the granting of authorisation referred to in paragraph 1 subject to any
conditions they deem appropriate.

3. The authorisation shall be granted only if by use of the accounting segregation method it can be ensured that, at
any time, the number of products obtained which could be considered as originating in the Union or in Viet Nam is the
same as the number that would have been obtained by using a method of physical segregation of the stocks.

4. If authorised, the accounting segregation method and its application shall be recorded on the basis of the general
accounting principles applicable in the Union or in Viet Nam, depending on where the product is manufactured.

5. A manufacturer using the accounting segregation method shall make out or apply for origin declarations for the
quantity of products which may be considered as originating in the exporting Party. At the request of the customs
authorities or the competent authorities of the exporting Party, the beneficiary shall provide a statement of how the
quantities have been managed.

6. The competent authorities shall monitor the use made of the authorisation referred to in paragraph 3 and may
withdraw it if the manufacturer makes improper use of it or fails to fulfil any of the other conditions laid down in this
Protocol.

(b) have not undergone any operation beyond what is necessary to preserve them in good condition while they were in
that third country or while being exported.

Article 13

Non-Alteration

1. The products declared for home use in a Party shall be the same products as exported from the other Party in which
they are considered to originate. They shall not have been altered, transformed in any way or subjected to operations
other than operations to preserve them in good condition or other than adding or affixing marks, labels, seals or any
other documentation to ensure compliance with specific domestic requirements of the importing Party carried out under
customs supervision in the country or countries of transit or splitting prior to being declared for home use.

2. Storage of products or consignments may take place provided they remain under customs supervision in the
country or countries of transit.

4. Each Party shall permit, in accordance with that Party’s laws and regulations, exporters in its territory to maintain
documentation or records in any form or medium, provided that the documentation or records can be retrieved and
printed.

Article 27

Discrepancies and Formal Errors

1. The discovery of slight discrepancies between the statements made in the proof of origin and those made in the
documents submitted to the customs office for the purpose of carrying out the formalities for importing the products
shall not ipso facto render the proof of origin null and void if it is duly established that this document corresponds to the
products submitted.

2. Obvious formal errors such as typing errors on a proof of origin shall not cause this document to be rejected if
these errors are not such as to create doubts concerning the correctness of the statements made in this document.

3. For multiple goods declared under the same proof of origin, a problem encountered with one of the goods listed
shall not affect or delay the granting of preferential tariff treatment and customs clearance of the remaining goods listed
in the proof of origin.

Article 28

Amounts Expressed in Euro

1. For the application of subparagraph 1(b)(ii) of Article 15 (General Requirements) and subparagraph 3(a) of
Article 24 (Exemptions from Proof of Origin) in cases where products are invoiced in a currency other than euro,
amounts in the national currencies of the Member States of the Union or of Viet Nam equivalent to the amounts
expressed in euro shall be fixed annually by each Party.

2. A consignment shall benefit from subparagraph 1(b)(ii) of Article 15 (General Requirements) and subparagraph 3(a)
of Article 24 (Exemptions from Proof of Origin) by reference to the currency in which the invoice is drawn up, according
to the amount fixed by the Party concerned.

3. The amounts to be used in any given national currency shall be the equivalent in that currency of the amounts
expressed in euro as at the first working day of October. The amounts shall be communicated to the European
Commission by 15 October and shall apply from 1 January of the following year. The European Commission shall
notify all countries concerned of the relevant amounts.

4. A Party may round up or down the amount resulting from the conversion into its national currency of an amount
expressed in euro. The rounded-off amount may not differ from the amount resulting from the conversion by more than
5 per cent. A Party may retain unchanged its national currency equivalent of an amount expressed in euro if, at the time
of the annual adjustment provided for in paragraph 3, the conversion of that amount, prior to any rounding-off, results
in an increase of less than 15 per cent in the national currency equivalent. The national currency equivalent may be
retained unchanged if the conversion would result in a decrease in that equivalent value.

5. The amounts expressed in euro shall be reviewed by the Committee on Customs at the request of the Union or of
Viet Nam. When carrying out that review, the Committee on Customs shall consider the desirability of preserving the
effects of the limits concerned in real terms. For that purpose, it may decide to modify the amounts expressed in euro.

Section E

Arrangements for administrative cooperation

Article 29

Cooperation between Competent Authorities

1. The authorities of the Parties shall provide each other, through the European Commission, with specimen
impressions of stamps used in their competent authorities for the issue of certificates of origin and with the addresses
of the customs authorities responsible for verifying those certificates and origin declarations.

2. In order to ensure the proper application of this Protocol, the Parties shall assist each other, through their
competent authorities, in verifying the authenticity of the certificates of origin or the origin declarations and the
correctness of the information given in these documents.

L 186/1332 Official Journal of the European Union 12.6.2020

Article 30

Verification of Proofs of Origin

1. Subsequent verifications of proofs of origin shall be carried out at random or whenever the competent authorities of
the importing Party have reasonable doubts as to the authenticity of such documents, the originating status of the
products concerned or the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol.

2. For the purpose of implementing the provisions of paragraph 1, the competent authorities of the importing Party
shall return the certificate of origin and the invoice, if it has been submitted, or the origin declaration, or a copy of these
documents, to the competent authorities of the exporting Party giving, where appropriate, the reasons for the enquiry.
Any documents and information obtained suggesting that the information given on the proof of origin is incorrect shall
be forwarded in support of the request for verification.

3. The verification shall be carried out by the competent authorities of the exporting Party. For that purpose, they shall
have the right to request any evidence and to carry out any inspection of the exporter’s accounts or any other check
considered appropriate.

4. If the competent authorities of the importing Party decide to suspend the granting of preferential tariff treatment to
the products concerned while awaiting the results of the verification, release of the products shall be offered to the
importer subject to any precautionary measures deemed necessary. Any suspension of preferential tariff treatment shall be
reinstated as soon as possible after the originating status of the products concerned or the fulfilment of the other
requirements of this Protocol has been ascertained by the competent authorities of the importing Party.

5. The competent authorities requesting the verification shall be informed of the results of this verification as soon as
possible. These results must indicate clearly whether the documents are authentic and whether the products concerned
can be considered as products originating in the Parties and fulfil the other requirements of this Protocol.

6. If in cases of reasonable doubt there is no reply within 10 months of the date of the verification request or if the
reply does not contain sufficient information to determine the authenticity of the document in question or the real origin
of the products, the requesting competent authorities may, except in exceptional circumstances, refuse entitlement to the
preferential tariff treatment.

Article 31
Dispute Settlement
1. Where disputes arise in relation to the verification procedures provided for in Article 30 (Verification of Proofs of

Origin) which cannot be settled between the competent authorities requesting a verification and the competent authorities
responsible for carrying out this verification, they shall be submitted to the Committee on Customs.

2. Disputes between the importer and the competent authorities of the importing Party, shall be settled in accordance
with the legislation of that Party.

Article 32
Penalties
Each Party shall provide for procedures for penalties to be imposed on any person who draws up, or causes to be drawn

up, a document which contains incorrect information for the purpose of obtaining preferential tariff treatment for
products.

Article 33
Confidentiality

Each Party shall maintain, in accordance with its law, the confidentiality of information and data collected in the process
of verification and shall protect that information and data from disclosure that could prejudice the competitive position
of the person providing them. Any information and data communicated between the authorities of the Parties competent
for the administration and enforcement of origin determination shall be treated as confidential.

12.6.2020 Official Journal of the European Union L 186/1335

ANNEX I to Protocol 1
INTRODUCTORY NOTES TO ANNEX II (LIST OF REQUIRED WORKING OR PROCESSING)

Note 1 — General Introduction

The list in Annex II to Protocol 1 sets out the conditions required for all products to be considered as sufficiently worked
or processed within the meaning of Article 5 (Sufficiently Worked or Processed Products). There are four different types
of rules, which vary according to the product:

(a) through working or processing a maximum content of non-originating materials is not exceeded;

(b) through working or processing the four-digit HS heading or six-digit HS subheading of the manufactured products
becomes different from the four-digit HS heading or six-digit HS subheading, respectively, of the materials used.
However, in the case set out in the second paragraph of Note 3.3., the four-digit HS heading or six-digit HS
subheading of the manufactured products may be the same as the four-digit HS heading or six-digit HS subheading,
respectively, of the materials used;

(c) a specific working and processing operation is carried out; or
(d) working or processing is carried out on certain wholly obtained materials.

Note 2 — The Structure of the List of Required Working or Processing

2.1. The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column gives the heading number or
Chapter number used in the HS and the second column gives the description of goods used in that system for that
heading or Chapter. For each entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in column 3. Where, in some cases,
the entry in the first column is preceded by an "ex", this signifies that the rules in column 3 apply only to the part
of that heading as described in column 2.

2.2. Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a Chapter number is given and the
description of products in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rules in column 3 apply
to all products which, under the HS, are classified in headings of the Chapter or in any of the headings grouped
together in column 1.

2.3. Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each indent contains the
description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rules in column 3.

2.4. Where two alternative rules are set out in column 3 that are separated by use of a different line and linked by an

"or", it shall be at the choice of the exporter which one to use.

Note 3 — Examples of How to Apply the Rules

3.1. Article 5 (Sufficiently Worked or Processed Products), concerning products having acquired originating status which
are used in the manufacture of other products, applies regardless of whether that status has been acquired inside the
factory where those products are used or in another factory in a Party.


--- PAGE 17 ---

L 186/1336 Official Journal of the European Union 12.6.2020

3.2. Pursuant to Article 6 (Insufficient Working or Processing), the working or processing carried out must go beyond
the list of operations mentioned in that Article. If it does not, the goods shall not qualify for the granting of the
preferential tariff treatment, even if the conditions set out in the list below are met.

Subject to the first paragraph, the rules in the list represent the minimum amount of working or processing
required. The carrying-out of more working or processing also confers originating status, without prejudice to
Article 6 (Insufficient Working or Processing). Conversely, the carrying-out of less working or processing shall not
confer originating status.

3.3. Where a rule uses the expression "Manufacture from materials of any heading, except that of the product" all non-
originating materials classified in headings other than that of the product may be used (Change in Tariff Heading).

Where a rule uses the expression "Manufacture from materials of any heading", then materials of any heading(s)
(even materials of the same description and heading as the product) may be used.

3.4. Where a rule uses the expression "Manufacture in which the value of all the materials used does not exceed x % of
the ex-works price of the product" then the value of all non-originating materials is to be considered and the
percentage for the maximum value of non-originating materials may not be exceeded through the use of
paragraph 3 of Article 5 (Sufficiently Worked or Processed Products).

3.5 If a rule provides that a specific non-originating material may be used, the use of materials which are still in an
earlier stage of the manufacturing process of that specific material is allowed, and the use of materials resulting
from further processing of that specific non-originating material is not.

If a rule provides that a specific non-originating material may not be used, the use of materials which are still in an
earlier stage of the manufacturing process of that specific non-originating material is allowed, and the use of
materials resulting from further processing of that specific non-originating material is not.

Example: when the rule for Chapter 19 requires that "non-originating materials of headings 1101 to 1108 cannot
exceed 20 % of the weight", the use of non-originating cereals of Chapter 10 (materials at an earlier stage in the
manufacturing process of goods of headings 1101 to 1108) is not limited by the requirement concerning the 20 %
of the weight.

3.6. When a rule specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one material, one or more materials
may be used. It does not require that all materials be used.

3.7. Where a rule specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular material, it does not prevent the use
of other materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy that requirement.

Example: Flat-rolled products of iron and non-alloy steel, of a width of 600 mm or more, which have been painted,
varnished or coated with plastics are classified in the HS under 7210 70. The rule for 7210 is "Manufacture from
ingots or other primary forms or semi-finished materials of heading 7206 or 7207". This rule does not prevent the
use of non-originating paint and varnish (heading 3208) or plastics (Chapter 39).

Note 4 — General Provisions Concerning Certain Agricultural Goods

4.1. Agricultural goods falling within Chapters 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 12 and heading 2401 which are grown or harvested in
a Party shall be treated as originating in that Party, even if grown from seeds, bulbs, rootstock, cuttings, grafts,
shoots, buds, or other live parts of plants imported from a third country.

4.2 Whenever the rules for products in Chapters 1 to 24 incorporate some limitations in weight, it should be noted
that in accordance with paragraph 2 of Article 5 (Sufficiently Worked or Processed Products), those limitations in
weight only apply to non-originating materials. Consequently, originating materials are not to be taken into account
for the calculation of the limitations in weight. In addition, those limitations are expressed in different manners. In
particular:

(a) When the rule uses the expression "the weight of the materials of Chapters/headings", the weight of each
material mentioned shall be added up and the total weight shall not exceed the maximum percentage.

Example: The rule for Chapter 19 provides that the weight of the materials of Chapters 2, 3 and 16 used does
not exceed 20 % of the weight of the final product. In case the weight of the final product contains 12 % of
materials of Chapter 3 and 10 % of materials of Chapter 16, the product does not meet the origin conferring
rule of Chapter 19 as the combined weight exceeds 20 % of the weight of the final product.

(b) When the rule uses the expression "the individual weight of the materials of Chapters/headings" the weight of
each material mentioned shall not exceed the maximum percentage. The combined weight of the materials
added together has no relevance.

Example: The rule for Chapter 22 provides that the individual weight of sugar and of the materials of Chapter 4
does not exceed 20 % of the weight of the final product. In case the weight of the final product contains 15 %
of sugar as well as 10 % of materials of Chapter 4, the origin conferring rule of Chapter 22 is complied with.
Each individual material is less than 20 % of the weight of the final product. On the contrary, in case the weight
of the final product contains 25 % of sugar and 10 % of materials of Chapter 4, the origin conferring rule is not
complied with.

(c) When the rule uses the expression "the total combined weight of sugar and the materials of Chapter 4 used
does not exceed x % of the weight of the final product", both the weight of the sugar and the materials of
Chapter 4 shall meet individually their weight limitation, and their combined weights added up shall meet the
combined weight limitation. A combined weight limitation expresses a further restriction to the individual
weight limitations.

Example: The rule for heading 1704 provides that the total combined weight of sugar and the materials of
Chapter 4 used does not exceed 50 % of the weight of the final product. The individual weight limitations for
materials of Chapter 4 are 20 % and for sugar 40 %. In case the weight of the final product contains 35 % of
sugar and 15 % of materials of Chapter 4, both the individual weight limitations and the combined weight
limitations of the origin conferring rule of heading 1704 are complied with. On the contrary, in case the weight
of the final product contains 35 % of sugar and 20 % of materials of Chapter 4, the combined weight represents
55 % of the weight of the final product. In that case the individual weight limitations are respected but the
combined weight limitation is exceeded and therefore the origin conferring rule of heading 1704 is not
complied with.

Note 5 — Terminology Used in Respect of Certain Textile Products

5.1. The term "natural fibres" is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic fibres. It is restricted to
the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres which have
been carded, combed or otherwise processed, but not spun.


--- PAGE 19 ---

L 186/1338 Official Journal of the European Union 12.6.2020

5.2. The term "natural fibres" includes horsehair of heading 0511, silk of headings 5002 and 5003, as well as wool-
fibres and fine or coarse animal hair of headings 5101 to 5105, cotton fibres of headings 5201 to 5203, and other
vegetable fibres of headings 5301 to 5305.

5.3. The terms "textile pulp", "chemical materials" and "paper-making materials" are used in the list to describe the
materials, not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres
or yarns.

5.4. The term "man-made staple fibres" is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament tow, staple fibres or
waste of headings 5501 to 5507.

Note 6 — Tolerances Applicable to Products Made of a Mixture of Textile Materials

6.1. Where, for a given product in the list, reference is made to this Note, the conditions set out in column 3 shall not
be applied to any basic textile materials used in the manufacture of this product and which, taken together,
represent 10 % or less of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also Notes 6.3 and 6.4).

6.2. However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 6.1 may be applied only to mixed products which have been made from
two or more basic textile materials.

The following are the basic textile materials:

— silk,

— wool,

— coarse animal hair,

— fine animal hair,

— horsehair,

— cotton,

— paper-making materials and paper,

— flax,

— true hemp,

— jute and other textile bast fibres,

— sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave,
— coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres,
— synthetic man-made filaments,

— artificial man-made filaments,

— current-conducting filaments,

— products of heading 5605 (metallised yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a
core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched

by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film,

— other products of heading 5605,

— glass fibres,

— metal fibres.

Example: A yarn of heading 5205, made from cotton fibres of heading 5203 and synthetic staple fibres of
heading 5506, is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres which do not satisfy the origin

rules may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 10 % of the weight of the yarn.

Example: A woollen fabric of heading 5112, made from woollen yarn of heading 5107 and synthetic yarn of staple
fibres of heading 5509, is a mixed fabric. Therefore, synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the origin rules, or
woollen yarn which does not satisfy the origin rules, or a combination of the two, may be used, provided that their
total weight does not exceed 10 % of the weight of the fabric.

Note

8.1.

Example: Tufted textile fabric of heading 5802, made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and cotton fabric of
heading 5210, is only a mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric made from yarns classified in two
separate headings, or if the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.

Example: If the tufted textile fabric concerned was made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and synthetic fabric of
heading 5407, the yarns used are two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is, accordingly, a
mixed product.

In the case of products incorporating "yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether,
whether or not gimped", this tolerance is 20 % in respect of this yarn.

In the case of products incorporating "strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film
whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a
transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film", this tolerance is 30 % in respect of this strip.

7 — Other Tolerances Applicable to Certain Textile Products
Where, in the list, reference is made to this Note, textile materials which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in

column 3 for the made-up product concerned, may be used, provided that they are classified in a heading other
than that of the product and that their value does not exceed 8 % of the ex-works price of the product.

Without prejudice to Note 7.3, materials which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63 may be used freely in
the manufacture of textile products, whether or not they contain textiles.

Example: If a rule provides that, for a particular textile item (such as trousers), yarn shall be used, it does not
prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because buttons are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63. For the
same reason, it does not prevent the use of slide-fasteners, even though slide-fasteners normally contain textiles.

Where a percentage rule applies, the value of non-originating materials which are not classified within Chapters 50
to 63 shall be taken into account when calculating the value of the non-originating materials incorporated.

8 — Definition of Specific Processes and Simple Operations Carried out in Respect of Certain Products of Chapter 27

For the purposes of headings ex 2707 and 2713, the "specific processes" are the following:

(a) vacuum-distillation;

(b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process;

(c) cracking;

(d) reforming;

(e) extraction by means of selective solvents;

(f) the process comprising all of the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or
sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification with naturally active
earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;


--- PAGE 22 ---

12.6.2020

8.2.

8.3.

Official Journal of the European Union L 186/1341

(g) polymerisation;

(h) alkylation; and

(i) isomerisation.

For the purposes of headings 2710, 2711 and 2712, the "specific processes" are the following:
(a) vacuum-distillation;

(b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process;

(c) cracking;

(d) reforming;

(e) extraction by means of selective solvents;

(f) the process comprising all of the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or
sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification with naturally active
earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;

(g) polymerisation;
(hb) alkylation;
(i) isomerisation;

(j) in respect of heavy oils of heading ex 2710 only, desulphurisation with hydrogen, resulting in a reduction of at
least 85 % of the sulphur content of the products processed (ASTM D 1266-59 T method);

(k) in respect of products of heading 2710 only, deparaffining by a process other than filtering;

() in respect of heavy oils of heading ex 2710 only, treatment with hydrogen, at a pressure of more than 20 bar
and a temperature of more than 250 °C, with the use of a catalyst, other than to effect desulphurisation, when
the hydrogen constitutes an active element in a chemical reaction. The further treatment, with hydrogen, of
lubricating oils of heading ex 2710 (e.g. hydrofinishing or decolourisation), in order, more especially, to
improve colour or stability shall not, however, be deemed to be a specific process;

(m) in respect of fuel oils of heading ex 2710 only, atmospheric distillation, on condition that less than 30 % of
these products distils, by volume, including losses, at 300 °C, by the ASTM D 86 method;

(n) in respect of heavy oils other than gas oils and fuel oils of heading ex 2710 only, treatment by means of a
high-frequency electrical brush discharge; and

(0) in respect of crude products (other than petroleum jelly, ozokerite, lignite wax or peat wax, paraffin wax
containing by weight less than 0,75 % of oil) of heading ex 2712 only, de-oiling by fractional crystallisation.

For the purposes of headings ex 2707 and 2713, simple operations, such as cleaning, decanting, desalting, water
separation, filtering, colouring, marking, obtaining a sulphur content as a result of mixing products with different
sulphur contents, or any combination of these operations or like operations, do not confer origin.
